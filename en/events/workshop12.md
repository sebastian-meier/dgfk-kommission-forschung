__October 8th, 2012, Hannover (just before Intergeo and Kartographentag 2012)__

### Scope
As the amount of user generated, spatio-temporal data grows exponentially, also the necessity of suitable cartographical representations increases more and more. Hence, this Workshop will address special aspects related to the generation of maps from user generated data, among others the topics of the workshop can be as follows:

- Technical aspects (such as programming APIs, data formats, etc.)
- Specific design aspects in the face of user orientation, participation, collaboration
- Quality of map design and measures for quality assurance
- Aspects of data privacy

Both theoretical work and best practice applications are expected, of course, also ongoing work is welcome.

### Important dates:

March 31, 2012: Submission of abstracts (approx. 1 page, PDF or MS Word format) - submit via <a href="mailto:jochen.schiewe@hcu-hamburg.de">E-Mail</a>

April 30, 2012: Notification of authors and publication of preliminary program.
