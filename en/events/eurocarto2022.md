*There is no strict limit on who we perceive as a young cartographer. If you perceive yourself as a next generation cartographer, you are welcome to join us!*

### Introduction
Are you working on your thesis, dissertation or another research project? Or did you just finish something you would like to share? The workshop for next generation cartographers tries to provide a safe space for young scientist to share their work and connect with fellows. To participate, you don't need to be a "traditional cartographer". If you are working with spatial data, then you are in the right place. The focus of the workshop is on discussions and knowledge exchange between young academics. 

<!--### Call for Presentations
We are also open in regards to what you would like to present. We ask you, to limit your presentation time to 10-15 minutes. Because we are particularly interested in a conversation. We would like you to finish your presentations with a question, proposal or thought, as a starting point for a discussion.
To participate, send a (maximum) one-page description of your talk. Your submission should include: your **name**, affiliation is optional, a **title** and a 200 character **abstract**, which we can publish as part of the workshop program.

Please send your proposal to [sebastian.meier@fh-potsdam.de](mailto:sebastian.meier@fh-potsdam.de).

**Deadline: 15.08.2022**.

We also strongly encourage everyone to also submit to the [EuroCarto Call](https://eurocarto2022.org/call-for-papers/) (Deadline 30.04.2022).

### Discussion on career paths
Besides the presentations and discussions by young scientists, we want to try something new this year. We want to discuss potential career paths for cartographers. There are a lot of opportunities out there for cartographers (industry, non-profit, academia, ...). And a career path does not always need to be straight. Sebastian Meier will start with an input on cartographic working fields (as a non-cartographer) and then open the discussion. Anybody else who also wants to share similar insights is highly welcome, to also present something in this part of the workshop.

<!--### Hybrid?
Currently we are planning an offline-only event. Why? Providing a safe space for discussions is very important to us. With streamed events it is hard to control or be aware of who is participating. And things can easily be recorded. -->

### Social Event
Directly after the workshop, the official conference dinner will take place at Zwölf-Apostel-Keller, [Sonnenfelsgasse 3, 1010 Wien](https://osm.org/go/0JrJIka1w?m=). We offer to jointly go to the dinner location and hope to continue our conversations there in an even less formal setting. We will have a reserved table for all workshop participants.

### Workshop output
Beyond the discussions and exchange throughout the workshop, we would like to document the workshop and the perspectives of "next generation cartographers". We, therefore, plan to work on a joint publication after the workshop. Everyone is welcome to join us in this endeavour. 

<!--### Participation without a talk
Everybody is welcome to join the discussion. In order to help us better plan the event (room size, etc.), please send us a quick email and let us know if you are planning to participate: [sebastian.meier@fh-potsdam.de](mailto:sebastian.meier@fh-potsdam.de).-->

### Costs
The workshop is part of [EuroCarto](https://eurocarto2022.org/), therefore, free for all conference participants. If you are a local student, and you can only participate in the workshop, please get in touch.

### Workshop Commission
- Edyta Paulina Bogucka, Technical University Munich
- Florian Ledermann, Technical University Vienna
- Sebastian Meier, Potsdam University of Applied Sciences
- Robert Roth, University of Wisconsin-Madison
- Katarzyna Słomska-Przech, Tadeusz Manteuffel Institute of History, Polish Academy of Sciences

The workshop is supported by the ICA's [UX Commission](https://use.icaci.org/) and the DGfK's Research Commission.

### Code of Conduct
This workshop is specifically for young scientists. Young scientists with diverse backgrounds, in different stages of their careers and different perspectives. The workshop should provide a safe space for knowledge exchange, discussions and learning from one another. We wish for respectful and thoughtful interactions throughout the event.
