## Call for abstracts (May 31st)

Critical cartography has changed cartography fundamentally. For example, it has laid the foundations for participatory approaches, the critical reflection on maps as representations of power and expanded the range of topics covered by thematic cartography. In doing so, it has established an understanding for a change of perspectives.

Publications in recent years indicate a variety of perspectives on how critical cartography should be regarded against the background of current developments in the geo-information sciences (e.g. new software, new data resources, new end devices, new communication, artificial intelligence). What are the strengths of critical cartography today? Are aspects of critical cartography outdated and dysfunctional, resulting in a post-critical cartography? How should the critical perspective be evaluated against the backdrop of rapid technological changes, e.g. in the context of big data or artificial intelligence?

These and many more questions call for interdisciplinary exchange. We, Sebastian Meier (FH Potsdam) and Dennis Edler (Ruhr-Universität Bochum), therefore invite you to a joint workshop. We want to explore fundamental question around the current state of critical cartography. And invite researchers from all disciplines to share their diverse perspectives on this topic. The results will be published in a special issue entitled "The Future of Critical Cartography" in the journal "KN - Journal of Cartography and Geographic Information".

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 2024 [EuroCarto](https://eurocarto2024.org/) in Vienna (University of Technology).

**Date: September 8th**

**Time: TBA**

**Submission deadline: May 31st**

To actively participate with a presentation, please submit an abstract of one page, plus references, via email to: [dennis.edler@rub.de](dennis.edler@rub.de). Every submission is invited to participate in the special issue with a full paper based on their submission. Please be aware, that there will be a second round of peer reviews, for the special issue.
