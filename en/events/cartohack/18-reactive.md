At this month's CartoHack, we are going to take a look at reactive web apps and how to integrate maps into them. We explore the most common web-mapping frameworks ([leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/), [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/)/[Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), if we have enough time also [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) and [d3](https://d3js.org/)). As a reactive framework we will be using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but the general concepts can easily be transfered to frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). We will look into some basics of reactive web frameworks, but this will not be an indepth introduction to these frameworks. The idea for this CartoHack originated in an exploration of which mapping framework would result in the smallst footprint.
