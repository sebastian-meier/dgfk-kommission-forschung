The interactive notebook used in the CartoHack is available <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tqc5jBqMXPdP6j1FjmJXkXEToJw9mgRo">here</a>.

This first CartoHack is exploring weather data from the Germany Weather Service (DWD). From getting access, downloading, through processing, down to the visualisation of the data using (Python + Jupyter Notebooks. As a use case for weather data Sebastian will also introduce the project "<a href="https://giessdenkiez.de">Gieß den Kiez</a>" by CityLAB Berlin. The source code for the tutorial, as well as the code for "Gieß den Kiez" is open source, so if the talk gets you excited about weather data, feel free to dive deeper into the topic using the code examples.
