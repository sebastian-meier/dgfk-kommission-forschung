### Commission "Cartography and research"

The German Cartographic Society e.V. (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Kartographie e.V.) is a non-profit, economically independent and politically neutral institution of trade members in the field of cartography and people interested in mapping in general.

This Commission builds the **platform** for all persons involved in cartographic research and development. This includes members of universities and research institutes as well as persons from administrative agencies or companies who have strong research interests.

The Commission wants to generate an **overview over current research topics and potential co-operation possibilities**. Here the focus is on visualization topics; however, related topics from other disciplines are also of interest.

Furthermore the Commissions promotes **international activities and networks**, in particular together with colleagues from Austria or Switzerland as well as with the International Cartographic Assocation (ICA).
