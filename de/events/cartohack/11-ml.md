Pollock, Picasso, Monet or You – we will try to place the distinctive artistic styles on maps with the use of Machine Learning. This session will provide a friendly introduction to the creative use of neural style transfer, a technique that creates unique images based on two input images – one for the semantic content and one for the style.

No programming experience is required. Instead, we will style our maps with a few clicks using the RunwayML – experimental software that provides access to multiple pre-trained machine learning models.
