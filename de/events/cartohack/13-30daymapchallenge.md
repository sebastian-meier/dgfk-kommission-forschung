November is the month of the <a href="https://30daymapchallenge.com/">#30DayMapChallenge</a>, a global social event where every day, people make maps for a certain theme. Last year, Hannes did <a href="https://hannes.enjoys.it/blog/2022/11/30daymapchallenge-as-1day30mapschallenge-2021/">all the 30 maps in a single day</a> and this year he will do it again. A live stream will be available at <a href="https://live.nullisland.org/">live.nullisland.org</a> and you are cordially invited to tune in any time for a bit of mapping, fun and banter.

The theme of the day is Island(s), let's have a map-along of island(s) at 13:00 UTC / 14:00 CET?
